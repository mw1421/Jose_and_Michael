Brainstorm area
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
* My first thought is creating an environmental social media. We would have users, 
and those users can post about their eagle scout projects, conservation projects,
trash cleanups, beach cleanups, volunteer opportunities, fundraising and charities, etc.
Users would be able to donate to the site in a way that they can choose to donate to us,
the creators, or donate only to charities we (or our users) want to support. We would post
this website to /r/detrashed, /r/environment, /r/biology, etc to gain some traction.
